# Biography

I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2015 and 2017. Given my interest in optimization, I found it optimal to accomplish my M.Sc. by performing my thesis in "An Integrated Model of Pricing and Production with Reference Price Effect and Quality Diversity".
